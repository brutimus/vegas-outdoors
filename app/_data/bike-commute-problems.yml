        description: "Bicycle lanes exist north of, but end shortly before the I-215 crossing. Valle Verde is oftentimes low traffic, so traveling in the traffic lane is acceptable. Use caution on the end of the road as cracks between the asphalt and concrete pose dangers to narrow tires."

        description: "When crossing I-215 southbound, traveling in the traffic lane is acceptable, but be aware that after crossing, you will be stuck in a higher traffic lane, so you may want to exit to a side road or sidewalk immediately. Crossing northbound in the traffic lane is inadvisable due to it being uphill and the dangers of the very high traffic I-215 eastbound on ramp."
