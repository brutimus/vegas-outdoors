        <em>{{ site.name }}</em> was created to fill an obvious gap in Las Vegas' outdoor community. Many communities exist - rock climbing, road cycling, mountain biking, kayaking - but there was no central portal to discover all that the Las Vegas Valley has to offer.</p>

        <div class="col-md-4">
            <p>The Las Vegas Valley is rich with nearly every adventure you could ask for. On any given day, you can find yourself spandex-clad, cycling the miles away on open desert highways, paddling town the Colorado River to any of a number of hot springs, chalking up to scale many thousands of feet of perfect sandstone in Red Rocks, or simply choosing a different commute option and pedaling your way to the grocery store.</p>
            <p><em>{{ site.name }}</em> is not intended to compete with or replace any existing communities in Las Vegas. In fact, we would love and welcome the idea of cross contribution! Biking Las Vegas does a great job bringing together a big portion of the cycling community. Mountain Project is where the climbers go and will keep going. This site is only trying to draw the lines between the communities and give the amateur outdoorsman a starting point.</p>

                <p>I remember my first year living in Las Vegas &ndash; I had a bicycle, but thought the streets too dangerous. I knew there was rock climbing to be done here, but thought it too foreign of a concept for me to get into. It wasn't until I met a friend through work that I found myself catapulted into the outdoor community. During my years living here, I've heard this same story retold by many. <em>{{ site.name }}</em> is my attempt to unify all aspects of the outdoor community and give both newcomers and veterans alike the catalyst they need to get out and adventure!</p>
